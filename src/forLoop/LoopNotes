--> If we know number of iterations in advance then for loop is the best choice
--> Curly braces are optional and with out curly braces, we can take only one statement under for loop
	which should not be a declarative statement.

-->Initialization part will be executed only once in loop life cycle
-->here we can declare and initialize local variables of for loop
-->Here we can declare any number of variables but should be of same data type
-->if bimistake different data type variables then we will get compile time error	
-->In the initialization section any valid java statement can be taken including SOP statement

-->conditional check------optional
-->Here we can take any valid java expression of boolean type
-->if we are not declaring anything, complier takes "true" in conditional check
 
-->Increment or Decrement section
-->In this section, we can take any valid java statement including SOP statement.


-->All three parts of for loop are independent of each other and optional

For Each loop introduced in 1.5 version
It is specially designed loop to retrieve elements of Arrays and Collections

-->To print elements of one dimensional array

-->To print elements of two dimensional array
-->For each loop is the best choice to retrieve elements from Arrays and collections
--> but its limitation is it is applicable only for Arrays and collections and it is not a general purpose loop
-->By using normal for loop we can print array elements either in original order or in reverse order where as we can't do using 	each loop
