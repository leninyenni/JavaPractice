For Abstract class, its not possible to create object either directly or indirectly
Anyway, we can't create object for abstract class either directly or indirectly
but abstract class can contain constructor
Need:
The main objective of abstract class constructor is to perform initialization
for the instance variables which are inheriting from abstract class to the child class
-->Whenever we creating child class object, automatically abstract class constructor will be
executed to perform initialization for the instance variables which are inheriting from the abstract class
(this is we call code reusability)
